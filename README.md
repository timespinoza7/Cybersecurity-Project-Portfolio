Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio. This repository showcases practical, hands-on projects designed to demonstrate skills in network security, endpoint protection, auditing, and identity management. All work was completed in a safe, controlled environment using virtual labs, test networks, and legal tools.
